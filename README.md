# kmpeek
An in-progress 3D KMP editor for Mario Kart Wii, written in Rust using the [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) game engine! <br><br>
Currently it can't actually edit KMP files, though the functionality (e.g. opening, saving a KMP file) is there ready to be implemented. It can so far open KCL files and view them in different camera modes, along with editing the colours of different KCL types and hiding/showing them.
